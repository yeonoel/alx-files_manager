> :warning: In version 4.1.0 we moved our subpackages from `@node-redis` to `@redis`. If you're just using `npm install redis`, you don't need to do anything—it'll upgrade automatically. If you're using the subpackages directly, you'll need to point to the new scope (e.g. `@redis/client` instead of `@node-redis/client`).

## Installation

Start a redis via docker:

``` bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 -it redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

To install node-redis, simply:

```bash
npm install redis
```

> :warning: The new interface is clean and cool, but if you have an existing codebase, you'll want to read the [migration guide](./docs/v3-to-v4.md).

Looking for a high-level library to handle object mapping? See [redis-om-node](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-node)!

## Usage

### Basic Example

```typescript
import { createClient } from 'redis';

const client = createClient();

client.on('error', err => console.log('Redis Client Error', err));

await client.connect();

await client.set('key', 'value');
const value = await client.get('key');
await client.disconnect();
```

The above code connects to localhost on port 6379. To connect to a different host or port, use a connection string in the format `redis[s]://[[username][:password]@][host][:port][/db-number]`:

```typescript
createClient({
  url: 'redis://alice:foobared@awesome.redis.server:6380'
});
```

You can also use discrete parameters, UNIX sockets, and even TLS to connect. Details can be found in the [client configuration guide](./docs/client-configuration.md).

To check if the the client is connected and ready to send commands, use `client.isReady` which returns a boolean. `client.isOpen` is also available.  This returns `true` when the client's underlying socket is open, and `false` when it isn't (for example when the client is still connecting or reconnecting after a network error).

### Redis Commands

There is built-in support for all of the [out-of-the-box Redis commands](https://redis.io/commands). They are exposed using the raw Redis command names (`HSET`, `HGETALL`, etc.) and a friendlier camel-cased version (`hSet`, `hGetAll`, etc.):

```typescript
// raw Redis commands
await client.HSET('key', 'field', 'value');
await client.HGETALL('key');

// friendly JavaScript commands
await client.hSet('key', 'field', 'value');
await client.hGetAll('key');
```

Modifiers to commands are specified using a JavaScript object:

```typescript
await client.set('key', 'value', {
  EX: 10,
  NX: true
});
```

Replies will be transformed into useful data structures:

```typescript
await client.hGetAll('key'); // { field1: 'value1', field2: 'value2' }
await client.hVals('key'); // ['value1', 'value2']
```

`Buffer`s are supported as well:

```typescript
await client.hSet('key', 'field', Buffer.from('value')); // 'OK'
await client.hGetAll(
  commandOptions({ returnBuffers: true }),
  'key'
); // { field: <Buffer 76 61 6c 75 65> }
```

### Unsupported Redis Commands

If you want to run commands and/or use arguments that Node Redis doesn't know about (yet!) use `.sendCommand()`:

```typescript
await client.sendCommand(['SET', 'key', 'value', 'NX']); // 'OK'

await client.sendCommand(['HGETALL', 'key']); // ['key1', 'field1', 'key2', 'field2']
```

### Transactions (Multi/Exec)

Start a [transaction](https://redis.io/topics/transactions) by calling `.multi()`, then chaining your commands. When you're done, call `.exec()` and you'll get an array back with your results:

```typescript
await client.set('another-key', 'another-value');

const [setKeyReply, otherKeyValue] = await client
  .multi()
  .set('key', 'value')
  .get('another-key')
  .exec(); // ['OK', 'another-value']
```

You can also [watch](https://redis.io/topics/transactions#optimistic-locking-using-check-and-set) keys by calling `.watch()`. Your transaction will abort if any of the watched keys change.

To dig deeper into transactions, check out the [Isolated Execution Guide](./docs/isolated-execution.md).

### Blocking Commands

Any command can be run on a new connection by specifying the `isolated` option. The newly created connection is closed when the command's `Promise` is fulfilled.

This pattern works especially well for blocking commands—such as `BLPOP` and `BLMOVE`:

```typescript
import { commandOptions } from 'redis';

const blPopPromise = client.blPop(
  commandOptions({ isolated: true }),
  'key',
  0
);

await client.lPush('key', ['1', '2']);

await blPopPromise; // '2'
```

To learn more about isolated execution, check out the [guide](./docs/isolated-execution.md).

### Pub/Sub

See the [Pub/Sub overview](./docs/pub-sub.md).

### Scan Iterator

[`SCAN`](https://redis.io/commands/scan) results can be looped over using [async iterators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/asyncIterator):

```typescript
for await (const key of client.scanIterator()) {
  // use the key!
  await client.get(key);
}
```

This works with `HSCAN`, `SSCAN`, and `ZSCAN` too:

```typescript
for await (const { field, value } of client.hScanIterator('hash')) {}
for await (const member of client.sScanIterator('set')) {}
for await (const { score, value } of client.zScanIterator('sorted-set')) {}
```

You can override the default options by providing a configuration object:

```typescript
client.scanIterator({
  TYPE: 'string', // `SCAN` only
  MATCH: 'patter*',
  COUNT: 100
});
```

### [Programmability](https://redis.io/docs/manual/programmability/)

Redis provides a programming interface allowing code execution on the redis server.

#### [Functions](https://redis.io/docs/manual/programmability/functions-intro/)

The following example retrieves a key in redis, returning the value of the key, incremented by an integer. For example, if your key _foo_ has the value _17_ and we run `add('foo', 25)`, it returns the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything.

```lua
#!lua name=library

redis.register_function {
  function_name = 'add',
  callback = function(keys, args) return redis.call('GET', keys[1]) + args[1] end,
  flags = { 'no-writes' }
}
```

Here is the same example, but in a format that can be pasted into the `redis-cli`.

```
FUNCTION LOAD "#!lua name=library\nredis.register_function{function_name=\"add\", callback=function(keys, args) return redis.call('GET', keys[1])+args[1] end, flags={\"no-writes\"}}"
```

Load the prior redis function on the _redis server_ before running the example below.

```typescript
import { createClient } from 'redis';

const client = createClient({
  functions: {
    library: {
      add: {
        NUMBER_OF_KEYS: 1,
        transformArguments(key: string, toAdd: number): Array<string> {
          return [key, toAdd.toString()];
        },
        transformReply(reply: number): number {
          return reply;
        }
      }
    }
  }
});

await client.connect();

await client.set('key', '1');
await client.library.add('key', 2); // 3
```

#### [Lua Scripts](https://redis.io/docs/manual/programmability/eval-intro/)

The following is an end-to-end example of the prior concept.

```typescript
import { createClient, defineScript } from 'redis';

const client = createClient({
  scripts: {
    add: defineScript({
      NUMBER_OF_KEYS: 1,
      SCRIPT:
        'return redis.call("GET", KEYS[1]) + ARGV[1];',
      transformArguments(key: string, toAdd: number): Array<string> {
        return [key, toAdd.toString()];
      },
      transformReply(reply: number): number {
        return reply;
      }
    })
  }
});

await client.connect();

await client.set('key', '1');
await client.add('key', 2); // 3
```

### Disconnecting

There are two functions that disconnect a client from the Redis server. In most scenarios you should use `.quit()` to ensure that pending commands are sent to Redis before closing a connection.

#### `.QUIT()`/`.quit()`

Gracefully close a client's connection to Redis, by sending the [`QUIT`](https://redis.io/commands/quit) command to the server. Before quitting, the client executes any remaining commands in its queue, and will receive replies from Redis for each of them.

```typescript
const [ping, get, quit] = await Promise.all([
  client.ping(),
  client.get('key'),
  client.quit()
]); // ['PONG', null, 'OK']

try {
  await client.get('key');
} catch (err) {
  // ClosedClient Error
}
```

#### `.disconnect()`

Forcibly close a client's connection to Redis immediately. Calling `disconnect` will not send further pending commands to the Redis server, or wait for or parse outstanding responses.

```typescript
await client.disconnect();
```

### Auto-Pipelining

Node Redis will automatically pipeline requests that are made during the same "tick".

```typescript
client.set('Tm9kZSBSZWRpcw==', 'users:1');
client.sAdd('users:1:tokens', 'Tm9kZSBSZWRpcw==');
```

Of course, if you don't do something with your Promises you're certain to get [unhandled Promise exceptions](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_event_unhandledrejection). To take advantage of auto-pipelining and handle your Promises, use `Promise.all()`.

```typescript
await Promise.all([
  client.set('Tm9kZSBSZWRpcw==', 'users:1'),
  client.sAdd('users:1:tokens', 'Tm9kZSBSZWRpcw==')
]);
```

### Clustering

Check out the [Clustering Guide](./docs/clustering.md) when using Node Redis to connect to a Redis Cluster.

### Events

The Node Redis client class is an Nodejs EventEmitter and it emits an event each time the network status changes:

| Name                    | When                                                                               | Listener arguments                                         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `connect`               | Initiating a connection to the server                                              | *No arguments*                                             |
| `ready`                 | Client is ready to use                                                             | *No arguments*                                             |
| `end`                   | Connection has been closed (via `.quit()` or `.disconnect()`)                      | *No arguments*                                             |
| `error`                 | An error has occurred—usually a network issue such as "Socket closed unexpectedly" | `(error: Error)`                                           |
| `reconnecting`          | Client is trying to reconnect to the server                                        | *No arguments*                                             |
| `sharded-channel-moved` | See [here](./docs/pub-sub.md#sharded-channel-moved-event)                          | See  [here](./docs/pub-sub.md#sharded-channel-moved-event) |

> :warning: You **MUST** listen to `error` events. If a client doesn't have at least one `error` listener registered and an `error` occurs, that error will be thrown and the Node.js process will exit. See the [`EventEmitter` docs](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_error_events) for more details.

> The client will not emit [any other events](./docs/v3-to-v4.md#all-the-removed-events) beyond those listed above.

## Supported Redis versions

Node Redis is supported with the following versions of Redis:

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 7.0.z   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 6.2.z   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 6.0.z   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 5.0.z   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| < 5.0   | :x:                |

> Node Redis should work with older versions of Redis, but it is not fully tested and we cannot offer support.

redis - a node.js redis client
===========================

This is a complete and feature rich Redis client for node.js. __It supports all
Redis commands__ and focuses on high performance.

Install with:

    npm install redis

## Usage Example

```js
var redis = require("redis"),
    client = redis.createClient();

// if you'd like to select database 3, instead of 0 (default), call
// client.select(3, function() { /* ... */ });

client.on("error", function (err) {
    console.log("Error " + err);
});

client.set("string key", "string val", redis.print);
client.hset("hash key", "hashtest 1", "some value", redis.print);
client.hset(["hash key", "hashtest 2", "some other value"], redis.print);
client.hkeys("hash key", function (err, replies) {
    console.log(replies.length + " replies:");
    replies.forEach(function (reply, i) {
        console.log("    " + i + ": " + reply);
    });
    client.quit();
});
```

This will display:

    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$ node example.js
    Reply: OK
    Reply: 0
    Reply: 0
    2 replies:
        0: hashtest 1
        1: hashtest 2
    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$

Note that the API is entirely asynchronous. To get data back from the server,
you'll need to use a callback. From v.2.6 on the API supports camelCase and
snake_case and all options / variables / events etc. can be used either way. It
is recommended to use camelCase as this is the default for the Node.js
landscape.

### Promises

You can also use node_redis with promises by promisifying node_redis with
[bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) as in:

```js
var redis = require('redis');
bluebird.promisifyAll(redis.RedisClient.prototype);
bluebird.promisifyAll(redis.Multi.prototype);
```

It'll add a *Async* to all node_redis functions (e.g. return client.getAsync().then())

```js
// We expect a value 'foo': 'bar' to be present
// So instead of writing client.get('foo', cb); you have to write:
return client.getAsync('foo').then(function(res) {
    console.log(res); // => 'bar'
});

// Using multi with promises looks like:

return client.multi().get('foo').execAsync().then(function(res) {
    console.log(res); // => 'bar'
});
```

### Sending Commands

Each Redis command is exposed as a function on the `client` object.
All functions take either an `args` Array plus optional `callback` Function or
a variable number of individual arguments followed by an optional callback.
Examples:

```js
client.hmset(["key", "test keys 1", "test val 1", "test keys 2", "test val 2"], function (err, res) {});
// Works the same as
client.hmset("key", ["test keys 1", "test val 1", "test keys 2", "test val 2"], function (err, res) {});
// Or
client.hmset("key", "test keys 1", "test val 1", "test keys 2", "test val 2", function (err, res) {});
```

Note that in either form the `callback` is optional:

```js
client.set("some key", "some val");
client.set(["some other key", "some val"]);
```

If the key is missing, reply will be null. Only if the [Redis Command
Reference](http://redis.io/commands) states something else it will not be null.

```js
client.get("missingkey", function(err, reply) {
    // reply is null when the key is missing
    console.log(reply);
});
```

For a list of Redis commands, see [Redis Command Reference](http://redis.io/commands)

Minimal parsing is done on the replies. Commands that return a integer return
JavaScript Numbers, arrays return JavaScript Array. `HGETALL` returns an Object
keyed by the hash keys. All strings will either be returned as string or as
buffer depending on your setting. Please be aware that sending null, undefined
and Boolean values will result in the value coerced to a string!

# Redis Commands

This library is a 1 to 1 mapping to [Redis commands](https://redis.io/commands).
It is not a cache library so please refer to Redis commands page for full usage
details.

Example setting key to auto expire using [SET command](https://redis.io/commands/set)

```js
// this key will expire after 10 seconds
client.set('key', 'value!', 'EX', 10);
```

# API

## Connection and other Events

`client` will emit some events about the state of the connection to the Redis server.

### "ready"

`client` will emit `ready` once a connection is established. Commands issued
before the `ready` event are queued, then replayed just before this event is
emitted.

### "connect"

`client` will emit `connect` as soon as the stream is connected to the server.

### "reconnecting"

`client` will emit `reconnecting` when trying to reconnect to the Redis server
after losing the connection. Listeners are passed an object containing `delay`
(in ms) and `attempt` (the attempt #) attributes.

### "error"

`client` will emit `error` when encountering an error connecting to the Redis
server or when any other in node_redis occurs. If you use a command without
callback and encounter a ReplyError it is going to be emitted to the error
listener.

So please attach the error listener to node_redis.

### "end"

`client` will emit `end` when an established Redis server connection has closed.

### "drain" (deprecated)

`client` will emit `drain` when the TCP connection to the Redis server has been
buffering, but is now writable. This event can be used to stream commands in to
Redis and adapt to backpressure.

If the stream is buffering `client.should_buffer` is set to true. Otherwise the
variable is always set to false. That way you can decide when to reduce your
send rate and resume sending commands when you get `drain`.

You can also check the return value of each command as it will also return the
backpressure indicator (deprecated). If false is returned the stream had to
buffer.

### "warning"

`client` will emit `warning` when password was set but none is needed and if a
deprecated option / function / similar is used.

### "idle" (deprecated)

`client` will emit `idle` when there are no outstanding commands that are
awaiting a response.

## redis.createClient()
If you have `redis-server` running on the same machine as node, then the
defaults for port and host are probably fine and you don't need to supply any
arguments. `createClient()` returns a `RedisClient` object. Otherwise,
`createClient()` accepts these arguments:

* `redis.createClient([options])`
* `redis.createClient(unix_socket[, options])`
* `redis.createClient(redis_url[, options])`
* `redis.createClient(port[, host][, options])`

__Tip:__ If the Redis server runs on the same machine as the client consider
using unix sockets if possible to increase throughput.

#### `options` object properties
| Property  | Default   | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| host      | 127.0.0.1 | IP address of the Redis server |
| port      | 6379      | Port of the Redis server |
| path      | null      | The UNIX socket string of the Redis server |
| url       | null      | The URL of the Redis server. Format: `[redis:]//[[user][:password@]][host][:port][/db-number][?db=db-number[&password=bar[&option=value]]]` (More info avaliable at [IANA](http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/redis)). |
| parser    | javascript | __Deprecated__ Use either the built-in JS parser [`javascript`]() or the native [`hiredis`]() parser. __Note__ `node_redis` < 2.6 uses hiredis as default if installed. This changed in v.2.6.0. |
| string_numbers | null | Set to `true`, `node_redis` will return Redis number values as Strings instead of javascript Numbers. Useful if you need to handle big numbers (above `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER === 2^53`). Hiredis is incapable of this behavior, so setting this option to `true` will result in the built-in javascript parser being used no matter the value of the `parser` option. |
| return_buffers | false | If set to `true`, then all replies will be sent to callbacks as Buffers instead of Strings. |
| detect_buffers | false | If set to `true`, then replies will be sent to callbacks as Buffers. This option lets you switch between Buffers and Strings on a per-command basis, whereas `return_buffers` applies to every command on a client. __Note__: This doesn't work properly with the pubsub mode. A subscriber has to either always return Strings or Buffers. |
| socket_keepalive | true | If set to `true`, the keep-alive functionality is enabled on the underlying socket. |
| no_ready_check | false |  When a connection is established to the Redis server, the server might still be loading the database from disk. While loading, the server will not respond to any commands. To work around this, `node_redis` has a "ready check" which sends the `INFO` command to the server. The response from the `INFO` command indicates whether the server is ready for more commands. When ready, `node_redis` emits a `ready` event. Setting `no_ready_check` to `true` will inhibit this check. |
| enable_offline_queue |  true | By default, if there is no active connection to the Redis server, commands are added to a queue and are executed once the connection has been established. Setting `enable_offline_queue` to `false` will disable this feature and the callback will be executed immediately with an error, or an error will be emitted if no callback is specified. |
| retry_max_delay | null | __Deprecated__ _Please use `retry_strategy` instead._ By default, every time the client tries to connect and fails, the reconnection delay almost doubles. This delay normally grows infinitely, but setting `retry_max_delay` limits it to the maximum value provided in milliseconds. |
| connect_timeout | 3600000 | __Deprecated__ _Please use `retry_strategy` instead._ Setting `connect_timeout` limits the total time for the client to connect and reconnect. The value is provided in milliseconds and is counted from the moment a new client is created or from the time the connection is lost. The last retry is going to happen exactly at the timeout time. Default is to try connecting until the default system socket timeout has been exceeded and to try reconnecting until 1h has elapsed. |
| max_attempts | 0 | __Deprecated__ _Please use `retry_strategy` instead._ By default, a client will try reconnecting until connected. Setting `max_attempts` limits total amount of connection attempts. Setting this to 1 will prevent any reconnect attempt. |
| retry_unfulfilled_commands | false | If set to `true`, all commands that were unfulfilled while the connection is lost will be retried after the connection has been reestablished. Use this with caution if you use state altering commands (e.g. `incr`). This is especially useful if you use blocking commands. |
| password | null | If set, client will run Redis auth command on connect. Alias `auth_pass` __Note__ `node_redis` < 2.5 must use `auth_pass` |
| db | null | If set, client will run Redis `select` command on connect. |
| family | IPv4 | You can force using IPv6 if you set the family to 'IPv6'. See Node.js [net](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html) or [dns](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html) modules on how to use the family type. |
| disable_resubscribing | false | If set to `true`, a client won't resubscribe after disconnecting. |
| rename_commands | null | Passing an object with renamed commands to use instead of the original functions. For example, if you renamed the command KEYS to "DO-NOT-USE" then the rename_commands object would be: `{ KEYS : "DO-NOT-USE" }` . See the [Redis security topics](http://redis.io/topics/security) for more info. |
| tls | null | An object containing options to pass to [tls.connect](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_port_host_options_callback) to set up a TLS connection to Redis (if, for example, it is set up to be accessible via a tunnel). |
| prefix | null | A string used to prefix all used keys (e.g. `namespace:test`). Please be aware that the `keys` command will not be prefixed. The `keys` command has a "pattern" as argument and no key and it would be impossible to determine the existing keys in Redis if this would be prefixed. |
| retry_strategy | function | A function that receives an options object as parameter including the retry `attempt`, the `total_retry_time` indicating how much time passed since the last time connected, the `error` why the connection was lost and the number of `times_connected` in total. If you return a number from this function, the retry will happen exactly after that time in milliseconds. If you return a non-number, no further retry will happen and all offline commands are flushed with errors. Return an error to return that specific error to all offline commands. Example below. |

```js
var redis = require("redis");
var client = redis.createClient({detect_buffers: true});

client.set("foo_rand000000000000", "OK");

// This will return a JavaScript String
client.get("foo_rand000000000000", function (err, reply) {
    console.log(reply.toString()); // Will print `OK`
});

// This will return a Buffer since original key is specified as a Buffer
client.get(new Buffer("foo_rand000000000000"), function (err, reply) {
    console.log(reply.toString()); // Will print `<Buffer 4f 4b>`
});
client.quit();
```

retry_strategy example

```js
var client = redis.createClient({
    retry_strategy: function (options) {
        if (options.error && options.error.code === 'ECONNREFUSED') {
            // End reconnecting on a specific error and flush all commands with
            // a individual error
            return new Error('The server refused the connection');
        }
        if (options.total_retry_time > 1000 * 60 * 60) {
            // End reconnecting after a specific timeout and flush all commands
            // with a individual error
            return new Error('Retry time exhausted');
        }
        if (options.attempt > 10) {
            // End reconnecting with built in error
            return undefined;
        }
        // reconnect after
        return Math.min(options.attempt * 100, 3000);
    }
});
```

## client.auth(password[, callback])

When connecting to a Redis server that requires authentication, the `AUTH`
command must be sent as the first command after connecting. This can be tricky
to coordinate with reconnections, the ready check, etc. To make this easier,
`client.auth()` stashes `password` and will send it after each connection,
including reconnections. `callback` is invoked only once, after the response to
the very first `AUTH` command sent.
NOTE: Your call to `client.auth()` should not be inside the ready handler. If
you are doing this wrong, `client` will emit an error that looks
something like this `Error: Ready check failed: ERR operation not permitted`.

## backpressure

### stream

The client exposed the used [stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) in
`client.stream` and if the stream or client had to
[buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_writable_write_chunk_encoding_callback)
the command in `client.should_buffer`. In combination this can be used to
implement backpressure by checking the buffer state before sending a command and
listening to the stream
[drain](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_event_drain) event.

## client.quit()

This sends the quit command to the redis server and ends cleanly right after all
running commands were properly handled. If this is called while reconnecting
(and therefore no connection to the redis server exists) it is going to end the
connection right away instead of resulting in further reconnections! All offline
commands are going to be flushed with an error in that case.

## client.end(flush)

Forcibly close the connection to the Redis server. Note that this does not wait
until all replies have been parsed. If you want to exit cleanly, call
`client.quit()` as mentioned above.

You should set flush to true, if you are not absolutely sure you do not care
about any other commands. If you set flush to false all still running commands
will silently fail.

This example closes the connection to the Redis server before the replies have
been read. You probably don't want to do this:

```js
var redis = require("redis"),
    client = redis.createClient();

client.set("foo_rand000000000000", "some fantastic value", function (err, reply) {
    // This will either result in an error (flush parameter is set to true)
    // or will silently fail and this callback will not be called at all (flush set to false)
    console.log(err);
});
client.end(true); // No further commands will be processed
client.get("foo_rand000000000000", function (err, reply) {
    console.log(err); // => 'The connection has already been closed.'
});
```

`client.end()` without the flush parameter set to true should NOT be used in production!

## Error handling (>= v.2.6)

Currently the following error subclasses exist:

* `RedisError`: _All errors_ returned by the client
* `ReplyError` subclass of `RedisError`: All errors returned by __Redis__ itself
* `AbortError` subclass of `RedisError`: All commands that could not finish due
  to what ever reason
* `ParserError` subclass of `RedisError`: Returned in case of a parser error
  (this should not happen)
* `AggregateError` subclass of `AbortError`: Emitted in case multiple unresolved
  commands without callback got rejected in debug_mode instead of lots of
  `AbortError`s.

All error classes are exported by the module.

Example:
```js
var redis = require('./');
var assert = require('assert');
var client = redis.createClient();

client.on('error', function (err) {
    assert(err instanceof Error);
    assert(err instanceof redis.AbortError);
    assert(err instanceof redis.AggregateError);
    // The set and get get aggregated in here
    assert.strictEqual(err.errors.length, 2);
    assert.strictEqual(err.code, 'NR_CLOSED');
});
client.set('foo', 123, 'bar', function (err, res) { // Too many arguments
    assert(err instanceof redis.ReplyError); // => true
    assert.strictEqual(err.command, 'SET');
    assert.deepStrictEqual(err.args, ['foo', 123, 'bar']);

    redis.debug_mode = true;
    client.set('foo', 'bar');
    client.get('foo');
    process.nextTick(function () {
        // Force closing the connection while the command did not yet return
        client.end(true);
        redis.debug_mode = false;
    });
});

```

Every `ReplyError` contains the `command` name in all-caps and the arguments (`args`).

If node_redis emits a library error because of another error, the triggering
error is added to the returned error as `origin` attribute.

___Error codes___

node_redis returns a `NR_CLOSED` error code if the clients connection dropped.
If a command unresolved command got rejected a `UNCERTAIN_STATE` code is
returned. A `CONNECTION_BROKEN` error code is used in case node_redis gives up
to reconnect.

## client.unref()

Call `unref()` on the underlying socket connection to the Redis server, allowing
the program to exit once no more commands are pending.

This is an **experimental** feature, and only supports a subset of the Redis
protocol. Any commands where client state is saved on the Redis server, e.g.
`*SUBSCRIBE` or the blocking `BL*` commands will *NOT* work with `.unref()`.

```js
var redis = require("redis")
var client = redis.createClient()

/*
    Calling unref() will allow this program to exit immediately after the get
    command finishes. Otherwise the client would hang as long as the
    client-server connection is alive.
*/
client.unref()
client.get("foo", function (err, value){
    if (err) throw(err)
    console.log(value)
})
```

## Friendlier hash commands

Most Redis commands take a single String or an Array of Strings as arguments,
and replies are sent back as a single String or an Array of Strings. When
dealing with hash values, there are a couple of useful exceptions to this.

### client.hgetall(hash, callback)

The reply from an HGETALL command will be converted into a JavaScript Object by
`node_redis`. That way you can interact with the responses using JavaScript
syntax.

Example:

```js
client.hmset("hosts", "mjr", "1", "another", "23", "home", "1234");
client.hgetall("hosts", function (err, obj) {
    console.dir(obj);
});
```

Output:

```js
{ mjr: '1', another: '23', home: '1234' }
```

### client.hmset(hash, obj[, callback])

Multiple values in a hash can be set by supplying an object:

```js
client.HMSET(key2, {
    "0123456789": "abcdefghij", // NOTE: key and value will be coerced to strings
    "some manner of key": "a type of value"
});
```

The properties and values of this Object will be set as keys and values in the
Redis hash.

### client.hmset(hash, key1, val1, ... keyn, valn, [callback])

Multiple values may also be set by supplying a list:

```js
client.HMSET(key1, "0123456789", "abcdefghij", "some manner of key", "a type of value");
```

## Publish / Subscribe

Example of the publish / subscribe API. This program opens two
client connections, subscribes to a channel on one of them, and publishes to that
channel on the other:

```js
var redis = require("redis");
var sub = redis.createClient(), pub = redis.createClient();
var msg_count = 0;

sub.on("subscribe", function (channel, count) {
    pub.publish("a nice channel", "I am sending a message.");
    pub.publish("a nice channel", "I am sending a second message.");
    pub.publish("a nice channel", "I am sending my last message.");
});

sub.on("message", function (channel, message) {
    console.log("sub channel " + channel + ": " + message);
    msg_count += 1;
    if (msg_count === 3) {
        sub.unsubscribe();
        sub.quit();
        pub.quit();
    }
});

sub.subscribe("a nice channel");
```

When a client issues a `SUBSCRIBE` or `PSUBSCRIBE`, that connection is put into
a "subscriber" mode. At that point, only commands that modify the subscription
set are valid and quit (and depending on the redis version ping as well). When
the subscription set is empty, the connection is put back into regular mode.

If you need to send regular commands to Redis while in subscriber mode, just
open another connection with a new client (hint: use `client.duplicate()`).

## Subscriber Events

If a client has subscriptions active, it may emit these events:

### "message" (channel, message)

Client will emit `message` for every message received that matches an active subscription.
Listeners are passed the channel name as `channel` and the message as `message`.

### "pmessage" (pattern, channel, message)

Client will emit `pmessage` for every message received that matches an active
subscription pattern. Listeners are passed the original pattern used with
`PSUBSCRIBE` as `pattern`, the sending channel name as `channel`, and the
message as `message`.

### "message_buffer" (channel, message)

This is the same as the `message` event with the exception, that it is always
going to emit a buffer. If you listen to the `message` event at the same time as
the `message_buffer`, it is always going to emit a string.

### "pmessage_buffer" (pattern, channel, message)

This is the same as the `pmessage` event with the exception, that it is always
going to emit a buffer. If you listen to the `pmessage` event at the same time
as the `pmessage_buffer`, it is always going to emit a string.

### "subscribe" (channel, count)

Client will emit `subscribe` in response to a `SUBSCRIBE` command. Listeners are
passed the channel name as `channel` and the new count of subscriptions for this
client as `count`.

### "psubscribe" (pattern, count)

Client will emit `psubscribe` in response to a `PSUBSCRIBE` command. Listeners
are passed the original pattern as `pattern`, and the new count of subscriptions
for this client as `count`.

### "unsubscribe" (channel, count)

Client will emit `unsubscribe` in response to a `UNSUBSCRIBE` command. Listeners
are passed the channel name as `channel` and the new count of subscriptions for
this client as `count`. When `count` is 0, this client has left subscriber mode
and no more subscriber events will be emitted.

### "punsubscribe" (pattern, count)

Client will emit `punsubscribe` in response to a `PUNSUBSCRIBE` command.
Listeners are passed the channel name as `channel` and the new count of
subscriptions for this client as `count`. When `count` is 0, this client has
left subscriber mode and no more subscriber events will be emitted.

## client.multi([commands])

`MULTI` commands are queued up until an `EXEC` is issued, and then all commands
are run atomically by Redis. The interface in `node_redis` is to return an
individual `Multi` object by calling `client.multi()`. If any command fails to
queue, all commands are rolled back and none is going to be executed (For
further information look at
[transactions](http://redis.io/topics/transactions)).

```js
var redis  = require("./index"),
    client = redis.createClient(), set_size = 20;

client.sadd("bigset", "a member");
client.sadd("bigset", "another member");

while (set_size > 0) {
    client.sadd("bigset", "member " + set_size);
    set_size -= 1;
}

// multi chain with an individual callback
client.multi()
    .scard("bigset")
    .smembers("bigset")
    .keys("*", function (err, replies) {
        // NOTE: code in this callback is NOT atomic
        // this only happens after the the .exec call finishes.
        client.mget(replies, redis.print);
    })
    .dbsize()
    .exec(function (err, replies) {
        console.log("MULTI got " + replies.length + " replies");
        replies.forEach(function (reply, index) {
            console.log("Reply " + index + ": " + reply.toString());
        });
    });
```

### Multi.exec([callback])

`client.multi()` is a constructor that returns a `Multi` object. `Multi` objects
share all of the same command methods as `client` objects do. Commands are
queued up inside the `Multi` object until `Multi.exec()` is invoked.

If your code contains an syntax error an EXECABORT error is going to be thrown
and all commands are going to be aborted. That error contains a `.errors`
property that contains the concrete errors.
If all commands were queued successfully and an error is thrown by redis while
processing the commands that error is going to be returned in the result array!
No other command is going to be aborted though than the onces failing.

You can either chain together `MULTI` commands as in the above example, or you
can queue individual commands while still sending regular client command as in
this example:

```js
var redis  = require("redis"),
    client = redis.createClient(), multi;

// start a separate multi command queue
multi = client.multi();
multi.incr("incr thing", redis.print);
multi.incr("incr other thing", redis.print);

// runs immediately
client.mset("incr thing", 100, "incr other thing", 1, redis.print);

// drains multi queue and runs atomically
multi.exec(function (err, replies) {
    console.log(replies); // 101, 2
});
```

In addition to adding commands to the `MULTI` queue individually, you can also
pass an array of commands and arguments to the constructor:

```js
var redis  = require("redis"),
    client = redis.createClient(), multi;

client.multi([
    ["mget", "multifoo", "multibar", redis.print],
    ["incr", "multifoo"],
    ["incr", "multibar"]
]).exec(function (err, replies) {
    console.log(replies);
});
```

### Multi.exec_atomic([callback])

Identical to Multi.exec but with the difference that executing a single command
will not use transactions.

## client.batch([commands])

Identical to .multi without transactions. This is recommended if you want to
execute many commands at once but don't have to rely on transactions.

`BATCH` commands are queued up until an `EXEC` is issued, and then all commands
are run atomically by Redis. The interface in `node_redis` is to return an
individual `Batch` object by calling `client.batch()`. The only difference
between .batch and .multi is that no transaction is going to be used.
Be aware that the errors are - just like in multi statements - in the result.
Otherwise both, errors and results could be returned at the same time.

If you fire many commands at once this is going to boost the execution speed
significantly compared to firing the same commands in a loop without waiting for
the result! See the benchmarks for further comparison. Please remember that all
commands are kept in memory until they are fired.

## Monitor mode

Redis supports the `MONITOR` command, which lets you see all commands received
by the Redis server across all client connections, including from other client
libraries and other computers.

A `monitor` event is going to be emitted for every command fired from any client
connected to the server including the monitoring client itself. The callback for
the `monitor` event takes a timestamp from the Redis server, an array of command
arguments and the raw monitoring string.

Example:

```js
var client  = require("redis").createClient();
client.monitor(function (err, res) {
    console.log("Entering monitoring mode.");
});
client.set('foo', 'bar');

client.on("monitor", function (time, args, raw_reply) {
    console.log(time + ": " + args); // 1458910076.446514:['set', 'foo', 'bar']
});
```

# Extras

Some other things you might like to know about.

## client.server_info

After the ready probe completes, the results from the INFO command are saved in
the `client.server_info` object.

The `versions` key contains an array of the elements of the version string for
easy comparison.

    > client.server_info.redis_version
    '2.3.0'
    > client.server_info.versions
    [ 2, 3, 0 ]

## redis.print()

A handy callback function for displaying return values when testing. Example:

```js
var redis = require("redis"),
    client = redis.createClient();

client.on("connect", function () {
    client.set("foo_rand000000000000", "some fantastic value", redis.print);
    client.get("foo_rand000000000000", redis.print);
});
```

This will print:

    Reply: OK
    Reply: some fantastic value

Note that this program will not exit cleanly because the client is still connected.

## Multi-word commands

To execute redis multi-word commands like `SCRIPT LOAD` or `CLIENT LIST` pass
the second word as first parameter:

    client.script('load', 'return 1');
    client.multi().script('load', 'return 1').exec(...);
    client.multi([['script', 'load', 'return 1']]).exec(...);

## client.duplicate([options][, callback])

Duplicate all current options and return a new redisClient instance. All options
passed to the duplicate function are going to replace the original option. If
you pass a callback, duplicate is going to wait until the client is ready and
returns it in the callback. If an error occurs in the meanwhile, that is going
to return an error instead in the callback.

One example of when to use duplicate() would be to accommodate the connection-
blocking redis commands BRPOP, BLPOP, and BRPOPLPUSH.  If these commands
are used on the same redisClient instance as non-blocking commands, the
non-blocking ones may be queued up until after the blocking ones finish.

    var Redis=require('redis');
    var client = Redis.createClient();
    var clientBlocking = client.duplicate();

    var get = function() {
        console.log("get called");
        client.get("any_key",function() { console.log("get returned"); });
        setTimeout( get, 1000 );
    };
    var brpop = function() {
        console.log("brpop called");
        clientBlocking.brpop("nonexistent", 5, function() {
            console.log("brpop return");
            setTimeout( brpop, 1000 );
        });
    };
    get();
    brpop();

Another reason to use duplicate() is when multiple DBs on the same server are
accessed via the redis SELECT command.  Each DB could use its own connection.

## client.send_command(command_name[, [args][, callback]])

All Redis commands have been added to the `client` object. However, if new
commands are introduced before this library is updated or if you want to add
individual commands you can use `send_command()` to send arbitrary commands to
Redis.

All commands are sent as multi-bulk commands. `args` can either be an Array of
arguments, or omitted / set to undefined.

## client.add_command(command_name)

Calling add_command will add a new command to the prototype. The exact command
name will be used when calling using this new command. Using arbitrary arguments
is possible as with any other command.

## client.connected

Boolean tracking the state of the connection to the Redis server.

## client.command_queue_length

The number of commands that have been sent to the Redis server but not yet
replied to. You can use this to enforce some kind of maximum queue depth for
commands while connected.

## client.offline_queue_length

The number of commands that have been queued up for a future connection. You can
use this to enforce some kind of maximum queue depth for pre-connection
commands.

### Commands with Optional and Keyword arguments

This applies to anything that uses an optional `[WITHSCORES]` or `[LIMIT offset
count]` in the [redis.io/commands](http://redis.io/commands) documentation.

Example:

```js
var args = [ 'myzset', 1, 'one', 2, 'two', 3, 'three', 99, 'ninety-nine' ];
client.zadd(args, function (err, response) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('added '+response+' items.');

    // -Infinity and +Infinity also work
    var args1 = [ 'myzset', '+inf', '-inf' ];
    client.zrevrangebyscore(args1, function (err, response) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log('example1', response);
        // write your code here
    });

    var max = 3, min = 1, offset = 1, count = 2;
    var args2 = [ 'myzset', max, min, 'WITHSCORES', 'LIMIT', offset, count ];
    client.zrevrangebyscore(args2, function (err, response) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log('example2', response);
        // write your code here
    });
});
```

## Performance

Much effort has been spent to make `node_redis` as fast as possible for common
operations.

## Debugging

To get debug output run your `node_redis` application with `NODE_DEBUG=redis`.

This is also going to result in good stack traces opposed to useless ones
otherwise for any async operation.
If you only want to have good stack traces but not the debug output run your
application in development mode instead (`NODE_ENV=development`).

Good stack traces are only activated in development and debug mode as this
results in a significant performance penalty.

### Consolidation: It's time for celebration

Right now there are two great redis clients around and both have some advantages
above each other. We speak about ioredis and node_redis. So after talking to
each other about how we could improve in working together we (that is @luin and
@BridgeAR) decided to work towards a single library on the long run. But step by
step.

First of all, we want to split small parts of our libraries into others so that
we're both able to use the same code. Those libraries are going to be maintained
under the NodeRedis organization. This is going to reduce the maintenance
overhead, allows others to use the very same code, if they need it and it's way
easyer for others to contribute to both libraries.

We're very happy about this step towards working together as we both want to
give you the best redis experience possible.

If you want to join our cause by help maintaining something, please don't
hesitate to contact either one of us.
